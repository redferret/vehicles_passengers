# Vehicles and Passengers Prework
## Iteration 1
Use TDD to create a `Passenger` class that responds to the following interaction pattern. For the `adult?` method, a `Passenger` is considered an adult if they are age 18 or older.
```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/passenger'
# => true
pry(main)> charlie = Passenger.new({"name" => "Charlie", "age" => 18})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fc1ad88b3c0...>
pry(main)> taylor = Passenger.new({"name" => "Taylor", "age" => 12})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>
pry(main)> charlie.name
# => "Charlie"
pry(main)> charlie.age
# => 18
pry(main)> charlie.adult?
# => true
pry(main)> taylor.adult?
# => false
pry(main)> charlie.driver?
# => false
pry(main)> charlie.drive
pry(main)> charlie.driver?
# => true
```
## Iteration 2
Use TDD to create a `Vehicle` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:
```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/vehicle'
# => true
pry(main)> require './lib/passenger'
# => true
pry(main)> vehicle = Vehicle.new("2001", "Honda", "Civic")    
# => #<Vehicle:0x00007fe0da9c63d8...>
pry(main)> vehicle.year
# => "2001"
pry(main)> vehicle.make
# => "Honda"
pry(main)> vehicle.model
# => "Civic"
pry(main)> vehicle.speeding?
# => false
pry(main)> vehicle.speed
pry(main)> vehicle.speeding?
# => true
pry(main)> vehicle.passengers
# => []
pry(main)> charlie = Passenger.new({"name" => "Charlie", "age" => 18})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da1ec450...>
pry(main)> jude = Passenger.new({"name" => "Jude", "age" => 20})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2730e0...>
pry(main)> taylor = Passenger.new({"name" => "Taylor", "age" => 12})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>
pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(charlie)    
pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(jude)    
pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(taylor)    
pry(main)> vehicle.passengers
# => [#<Passenger:0x00007fe0da1ec450...>, #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2730e0...>, #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>]
pry(main)> vehicle.num_adults
# => 2
```

## Iteration 3
You have been contracted by the National Park Service to create a program that can track revenue for its parks. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following features:
  1. Each park has a unique name and admission price, as well as a way to read that data
  2. Each park can list all the vehicles that entered the park
  3. Each park can list all the passengers that entered the park
  4. Each park can calculate revenue generated. Revenue is generated by charging the admission price per adult that entered the park.
Build upon your existing code from the first two iterations to implement this functionality.
